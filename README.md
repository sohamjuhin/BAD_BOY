AD Ware
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adware, short for advertising-supported software, is a type of software that displays unwanted advertisements or promotional content to the user. It is designed to generate revenue for the software developer or distributor by serving advertisements or redirecting the user's web searches to sponsored websites.

Adware can come bundled with other free software or can be installed unknowingly when visiting certain websites. It often displays intrusive pop-up ads, inserts advertising banners into web browsers, alters search engine results, or tracks user browsing habits to deliver targeted ads. Some adware may also collect and transmit user data to third parties for marketing purposes.

While not inherently malicious like malware, adware can be disruptive, negatively impact system performance, and compromise user privacy. It is generally considered unwanted software and can be a nuisance to users who encounter it.

To protect against adware, it is recommended to use reputable antivirus or anti-malware software, exercise caution when downloading and installing software from unknown sources, and regularly update and patch operating systems and applications. Additionally, configuring web browsers to block pop-ups and avoiding suspicious websites can help mitigate the risk of encountering adware.
